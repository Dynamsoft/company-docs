# How can I edit my email address or add a new email address for license/maintenance renewal notification

You need to change the contacts of the corresponding order. All contacts will receive the renewal notification.

Step 1: Check if the contact you want to add/edit is one user under your company.

Please go to "Account Setting" - "Profile" and click "More Details" under "Company Info".

You will find "User List" of your company and search if the person is listed or not.

Step 2: 

- Case 1: If the person is listed on "User List", please go to "Order" - "My Order" and find the specified order. There is a button "Contact" on "Operations" column. Please click it and add/edit the contact email address and specify "Contact Type".

The person who is invited will receive an Invite Confirm Email. Once he/she confirms, he/she will be listed on "User List", then repeat the process in Case 1.

# How to unsubscribe the renewal notification

If the contact(s) is removed from the order contacts, the person cannot check the license detail of this order any more. If you just do not want to receive the renewal notification, please just unsubscribe it.
