# Can I upgrade my license(s) for free

If the maintenance of your license(s) is valid, you can request to upgrade it for free. Otherwise, you need to pay for the upgrade.

You can check the maintenance of your license(s) in **[Customer Portal](https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/) - License - Full License**. "Service Expiry Date" for each license means the maintenance expiry date.
