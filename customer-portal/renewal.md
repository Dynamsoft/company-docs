## How do I renew my software maintenance with Dynamsoft

When the maintenance of your license expires in 90 days, you will begin to receive our renewal reminder emails. We usually send a series of maintenance renewal follow-up emails (90 days before expiration, 60 days, 30 days, 14 days, 7 days, and the expiry date) to the order contacts. 

You can go to "Order" - "Upcoming Renewal" and check "Renew Support and Maintenance" tab. You will find all the license(s) whose maintenance could be renewed.

You can check all or one of them to renew.
